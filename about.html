    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a final-year Cybersecurity student at CSUF, where my passion for digital defense first took root in a high-school coding club and matured through hands-on lab work and competitive hacking events. Over the past three years, I’ve supplemented academic theory with real-world experience via my personal projects. These experiences taught me to balance technical rigor with clear communication—whether I’m drafting a risk report for executives or guiding teammates through a simulated breach.</p>
